- `PretestContext`: Pre-class test.
- `BoardContext`: Whiteboard.
- `Chat Context`: Chat.
- `RoomContext`: Classroom management.
- `HandsUpContext`: Hand-raising.
- `ScreenShareContext`: Screen sharing.
- `UserListContext`: User list.
- `RecordingContext`: Recording.
- `CloudDriveContext`: Class files.
- `StreamListContext`: Media stream and data stream.
- `MediaContext`: Local device control.

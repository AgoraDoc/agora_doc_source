# Work with extensions

Extensions are add-ons designed to extend the functionality of the Agora SDK. The Extensions Gallery is home to extensions that make your app more fun. These extensions provide features such as:

Audio effects and voice changing.
Face filters and background removal.
Live transcription and captioning.
This page shows you how to integrate and use an extension from the Agora Extensions Marketplace.

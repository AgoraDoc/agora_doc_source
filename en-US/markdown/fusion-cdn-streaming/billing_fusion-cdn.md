Agora Fusion-CDN Live Streaming calculates your bill based on the downlink traffic by default. Each account receives 800 GB of free-of-charge traffic each month.

At the end of each month, Agora determines the tiered pricing for usage based on the total traffic generated by all projects in all regions in the current month minus the 800 GB of free-of-charge usage. Once the pricing tier is determined, the individual region costs are determined. After deducting the monthly free-of-charge traffic in the order of regional unit price (from low to high), Agora then multiplies the remaining traffic by the corresponding unit price for each region, and adds up the regional costs to get the total usage cost for that month.

## Tiered pricing

The following table shows the unit price in each region under the tiered pricing (unit price: US$/GB):

| Total monthly traffic (GB) | China Mainland | North America | Europe | Asia Pacific 1 | Asia Pacific 2 | Oceania | Middle East & Africa | South Africa |
| :----------------------- | :------- | :--- | :--- | :-------- | :-------- | :----- | :------- | :--- |
| Total monthly traffic (GB) | China Mainland | North America | Europe | Asia Pacific 1 | Asia Pacific 2 | Oceania | Middle East & Africa | South Africa |
| 0 - 10,000 | 0.04 | 0.08 | 0.08 | 0.08 | 0.11 | 0.15 | 0.11 | 0.11 |
| 10,000 (included) - 50,000 | 0.04 | 0.07 | 0.07 | 0.07 | 0.11 | 0.14 | 0.11 | 0.11 |
| 50,000 (included) - 100,000 | 0.03 | 0.07 | 0.07 | 0.07 | 0.10 | 0.13 | 0.10 | 0.10 |
| 100,000 (included) - 1,000,000 | 0.03 | 0.06 | 0.06 | 0.06 | 0.09 | 0.12 | 0.09 | 0.09 |
| over 1,000,000 | 0.03 | 0.05 | 0.05 | 0.05 | 0.08 | 0.10 | 0.08 | 0.08 |

Region descriptions:

- Asia Pacific 1: Hong Kong (China), Macao (China), Taiwan (China), Japan, and Southeast Asia except for Vietnam and Indonesia.
- Asia Pacific 2: India, Indonesia, Republic of Korea, and Vietnam.
- Oceania: Australia and New Zealand.

## Example

Assuming that a project under your Agora account uses the Fusion-CDN Live Streaming service, the downlink streaming traffic generated in one month is as follows:

| Regions | Traffic (GB) |
| :-------- | :--------- |
| China Mainland | 500 |
| North America | 10,400 |
| Europe | 10,300 |
| Asia Pacific 1 | 200 |
| Total | 21,400 |

The total monthly cost is calculated as follows:

1. Deduct the monthly free-of-charge traffic to calculate the total billing traffic: 21,400 - 800 = 20,600 GB.

2. Determine the unit pricing tier: 20,600 falls between 10,000 and 50,000, so the unit prices in the second line apply to usage in all regions.

3. Determine which region has the lowest unit price and deduct the 800 GB of free-of-charge traffic. If that region has less than 800 GB of usage, deduct any remainder from the next lowest-priced region. Multiply the remaining traffic generated in each region by the corresponding unit price, as shown in the table below:

   | Regions | Actual traffic (GB) | Traffic after deduction (GB) | Unit price (US$/GB) | Cost (US$) |
   | :-------- | :------------- | :---------------------------- | :------------ | :-------------------- |
   | China Mainland | 500 | 500 - 500 = 0 | 0.04 | 0 × 0.04 = 0 |
   | North America | 10,400 | 10,400 - (800 - 500) = 10,100 | 0.07 | 10,100 × 0.07= 707 |
   | Europe | 10,300 | 10,300 | 0.07 | 10,300×0.07=721 |
   | Asia Pacific 1 | 200 | 200 | 0.07 | 200 × 0.07 = 14 |

4. Add up the costs of all regions to get the total cost for that month: 0 + 707 + 721 + 14 = US$1,442.

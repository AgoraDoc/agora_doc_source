## Data center geo-fencing

In order to meet the laws and regulations of different countries and regions, Agora Chat supports service area geo-fencing, which prevents cross-border data transfer of user privacy data in designated service areas.
Agora Chat's data centers and their service areas are listed as follows:

| Data Center    | Location           | Service Area   |
| :------------- | :----------------- | :------------- |
| Singapore      | Singapore          | Southeast Asia |
| Mainland China | Beijing            | Mainland China |
| Europe         | Frankfurt, Germany | Europe         |
| North America  | Virginia, US       | North America  |

To use Agora Chat, you need to specify a data center. After you select a data center, both the REST requests and the SDK API requests to the message server will be directed to the data center accordingly.
Once selected, the data center cannot be changed. Agora Chat does not support data migration across service areas. All data is stored in the designated data centers.

## Authentication with tokens

Agora Chat uses tokens to validate identity of end users. A token is a dynamic key generated by the application client with a validation period set by developers. It allows users to access Agora Chat only when they're authenticated. A token contains the important information including the following:

- The App ID of your Agora project
- The App Certificate of your Agora project
- The user ID of the user to be authenticated

## Data transmission and storage

The communication between users and the Agora Chat server is encrypted using transmission protocols, such as Agora Chat's private transmission protocol, Transport Layer Security (TLS), and Web Socket Secure (WSS). User data and messages generated by Agora Chat are stored in the designated data center. We retain your information only when you are using Agora Chat, and we will only keep the information for as long as we need in order to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected.

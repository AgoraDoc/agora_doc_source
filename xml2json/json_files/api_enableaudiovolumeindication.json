    "description": "Enables the reporting of users' volume indication.\nThis method enables the SDK to regularly report the volume information of the local user who sends a stream and remote users (up to three) whose instantaneous volumes are the highest to the app. Once you call this method and users send streams in the channel, the SDK triggers the audioVolumeIndication callback at the time interval set in this method.\n   You can call this method either before or after joining a channel.",

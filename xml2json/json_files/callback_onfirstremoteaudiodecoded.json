It means the local user cannot receive audio in 15 seconds. Reasons for such an interruption include:\n                            The remote user leaves channel.\n                            The remote user drops offline.\n                            The remote user calls muteLocalAudioStream to stop sending the audio stream.\n                            The remote user calls disableAudio to disable audio.",

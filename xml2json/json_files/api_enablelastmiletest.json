    "description": "Enables the network connection quality test.\nThis method tests the quality of the users' network connections. By default, this function is disabled. This method applies to the following scenarios:\n                    Before a user joins a channel, call this method to check the uplink network quality.\n                    Before an audience switches to a host, call this method to check the uplink network quality.\n                \n            \n            Regardless of the scenario, enabling this method consumes extra network traffic and affects the call quality. After receiving the lastmileQuality callback, call disableLastmileTest to stop the test, and then join the channel or switch to the host.\n            \n                \n                    Do not use this method together with startLastmileProbeTest.\n                    Do not call any other methods before receiving the lastmileQuality callback. Otherwise, the callback may be interrupted by other methods, and hence may not be triggered.\n                    A host should not call this method after joining a channel (when in a call).\n                    If you call this method to test the last mile network quality, the SDK consumes the bandwidth of a video stream, whose bitrate corresponds to the bitrate you set in setVideoEncoderConfiguration. After joining a channel, whether you have called disableLastmileTest or not, the SDK automatically stops consuming the bandwidth.",

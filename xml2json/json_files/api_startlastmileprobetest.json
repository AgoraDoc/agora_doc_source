    "description": "Starts the last mile network probe test.\nThis method starts the last-mile network probe test before joining a channel to get the uplink and downlink last mile network statistics, including the bandwidth, packet loss, jitter, and round-trip time (RTT).\n            Once this method is enabled, the SDK returns the following callbacks:\n                    lastmileQuality: The SDK triggers this callback within two seconds depending on the network conditions. This callback rates the network conditions and is more closely linked to the user experience.\n                    lastmileProbeResult: The SDK triggers this callback within 30 seconds depending on the network conditions. This callback returns the real-time statistics of the network conditions and is more objective.\n                \n            \n            This method applies to the following scenarios:\n                    Before a user joins a channel, call this method to check the uplink network quality.\n                    In a live streaming channel, call this method to check the uplink network quality before an audience member switches to a host.\n                \n            \n            \n                \n                    Do not call other methods before receiving the lastmileQuality and lastmileProbeResult callbacks. Otherwise, the callbacks may be interrupted.\n                    A host should not call this method after joining a channel (when in a call).",

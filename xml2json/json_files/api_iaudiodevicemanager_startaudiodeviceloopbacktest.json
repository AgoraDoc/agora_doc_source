    "description": "Starts an audio device loopback test.\nThis method tests whether the local audio capture device and playback device are working properly. After starting the test, the audio capture device records the local audio, and the audio playback device plays the captured audio. The SDK triggers two independent audioVolumeIndication callbacks at the time interval set in this method, which reports the volume information of the capture device (uid = 0) and the volume information of the playback device (uid = 1) respectively.\n   \n       Ensure that you call this method before joining a channel.\n       This method tests local audio devices and does not report the network conditions.",

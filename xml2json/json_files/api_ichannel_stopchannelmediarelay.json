Once the relay stops, the host quits all the destination channels.\nAfter a successful method call, the SDK triggers the channelMediaRelayStateChanged callback. If the callback reports Idle(0) and None(0), the host successfully stops the relay.\n   If the method call fails, the SDK triggers the channelMediaRelayStateChanged callback with the ServerNoResponse(2) or ServerConnectionLost(8) status code. You can call the leaveChannel method to leave the channel, and the media stream relay automatically stops.",

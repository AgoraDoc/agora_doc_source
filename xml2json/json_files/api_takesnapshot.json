After a successful method call, the SDK triggers snapshotTaken callback to report whether the snapshot is successfully taken as well as the details for the snapshot taken.\n                        Call this method after joining a channel.\n                        If the video of the specified user is pre-processed, for example, added with watermarks or image enhancement effects, the generated snapshot also includes the pre-processing effects.",

See the following methods instead:\n      startScreenCaptureByDisplayId\n      startScreenCaptureByWindowId\n  \n       \n   \n   This method shares the whole screen, a specified window, or the specified region:\n       Whole screen: Set windowId as 0 and rect as null.\n       A specified window: Set windowId as a value other than 0. Each window has a windowId that is not 0.\n       The specified region: Set windowId as 0 and rect as a value other than null. In this case, you can share the specified region, for example by dragging the mouse or implementing your own logic. The specified region is a region on the whole screen. Currently, sharing a specified region in a specific window is not supported.\n   \n   captureFreq is the captured frame rate once the screen-sharing function is enabled. The mandatory value ranges between 1 fps and 15 fps. No matter which of the above functions you enable, the SDK returns 0 when the execution succeeds, and an error code when the execution fails.",

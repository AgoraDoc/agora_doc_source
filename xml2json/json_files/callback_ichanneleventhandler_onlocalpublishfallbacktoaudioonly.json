    "description": "Occurs when the published media stream falls back to an audio-only stream.\nIf you call setLocalPublishFallbackOption and set option as AudioOnly, the SDK triggers this callback when the remote media stream falls back to audio-only mode due to poor uplink conditions, or when the remote media stream switches back to the video after the uplink network condition improves.\n   If the local stream falls back to the audio-only stream, the remote user receives the userMuteVideo callback.",

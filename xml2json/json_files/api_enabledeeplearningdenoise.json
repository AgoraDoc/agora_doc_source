    "description": "Enables/Disables deep-learning noise reduction.\nThe SDK enables traditional noise reduction mode by default to reduce most of the stationary background noise. If you need to reduce most of the non-stationary background noise, Agora recommends enabling deep-learning noise reduction as follows:\n       Ensure that the dynamic library is integrated in your project: libagora_ai_denoise_extension.dll\n       Call enableDeepLearningDenoise(true).\n   \n   Deep-learning noise reduction requires high-performance devices. The deep-learning noise reduction is enabled only when the device supports this function. For example, the following devices and later models are known to support deep-learning noise reduction:\n       iPhone 6S\n       MacBook Pro 2015\n       iPad Pro (2nd generation)\n       iPad mini (5th generation)\n       iPad Air (3rd generation)\n   \n   After successfully enabling deep-learning noise reduction, if the SDK detects that the device performance is not sufficient, it automatically disables deep-learning noise reduction and enables traditional noise reduction.\n   If you call enableDeepLearningDenoise(true) or the SDK automatically disables deep-learning noise reduction in the channel, when you need to re-enable deep-learning noise reduction, you need to call leaveChannel first, and then call enableDeepLearningDenoise(true).\n   \n       This method dynamically loads the library, so Agora recommends calling this method before joining a channel.\n       This method works best with the human voice. Agora does not recommend using this method for audio containing music.",

It is still valid after one leaves channel.\n       This method enables the audio module and takes some time to take effect. Agora recommends using the following API methods to control the audio module separately:\n  enableLocalAudio: Whether to enable the microphone to create the local audio stream.\n  muteLocalAudioStream: Whether to publish the local audio stream.\n  muteRemoteAudioStream: Whether to subscribe and play the remote audio stream.\n  muteAllRemoteAudioStreams: Whether to subscribe to and play all remote audio streams.",

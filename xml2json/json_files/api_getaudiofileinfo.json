To access an online file, Agora\n                            supports using a URL address; to access a local file, Agora supports using a URI address, an absolute path, or a path that starts\n                            with /assets/. You might encounter permission issues if you use an absolute path to access a local file, so Agora recommends\n                            using a URI address instead. For example: content://com.android.providers.media.documents/document/audio%3A14441.\n                        Windows: The absolute path or URL address (including the filename extensions) of the audio file.\n                            For example: C:\\music\\audio.mp4.\n                        iOS or macOS: The absolute path or URL address (including the filename extensions) of the audio file. For example: /var/mobile/Containers/Data/audio.mp4.\n                    "

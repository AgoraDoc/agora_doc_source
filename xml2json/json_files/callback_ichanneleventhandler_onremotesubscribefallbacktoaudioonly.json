    "description": "Occurs when the remote media stream falls back to audio-only stream due to poor network conditions or switches back to the video stream after the network conditions improve.\nIf you call setRemoteSubscribeFallbackOption and set option as AudioOnly, the SDK triggers this callback when the remote media stream falls back to audio-only mode due to poor downlink conditions, or when the remote media stream switches back to the video after the downlink network condition improves.\n   Once the remote media stream switches to the low stream due to poor network conditions, you can monitor the stream switch between a high and low stream in the RemoteVideoStats callback.",

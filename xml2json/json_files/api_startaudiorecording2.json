Please use startAudioRecordingWithConfig instead.\n                \n            \n            The Agora SDK allows recording during a call. After successfully calling this method, you can record the audio of all the users in the channel and get an audio recording file. Supported formats of the recording file are as follows:\n      .wav: Large file size with high fidelity.\n      .aac: Small file size with low fidelity.\n  \n       \n   \n       \n  Ensure that the directory you use to save the recording file exists and is writable.\n  This method should be called after the joinChannel method. The recording automatically stops when you call the leaveChannel method.\n  For better recording effects, set quality to Medium or High when sampleRate is 44.1 kHz or 48 kHz.",

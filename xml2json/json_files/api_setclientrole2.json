You can call this method to set the user role as host.\n            You can call this method either before or after joining a channel. If you call this method to switch the user role after joining a channel, the SDK automatically does the following:\n                Calls muteLocalAudioStream and muteLocalVideoStream to change the publishing state.\n                    Triggers clientRoleChanged on the local client.\n                    Triggers userJoined or userOffline on the remote client.\n                \n            This method applies to the interactive live streaming profile (the profile parameter of setChannelProfile is LiveBroadcasting) only.",

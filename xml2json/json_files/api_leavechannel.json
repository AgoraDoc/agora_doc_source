When this method returns, it does not necessarily mean that the user has left the channel.\n            A successful call of this method triggers the following callbacks:\n                    The local client: leaveChannel.\n                The remote client: userOffline, if the user joining the channel is in the Communication profile, or is a host in the Live-broadcasting profile.\n                \n            \n                \n                    If you call destroy immediately after calling this method, the SDK does not trigger the leaveChannel callback.\n                    If you call this method during a CDN live streaming, the SDK automatically calls the removePublishStreamUrl method.",

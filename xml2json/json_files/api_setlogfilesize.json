    "description": "Sets the size of a log file that the SDK outputs.\nBy default, the SDK outputs five log files: agorasdk.log, agorasdk_1.log, agorasdk_2.log, agorasdk_3.log, and agorasdk_4.log. Each log file has a default size of 512 KB. These log files are encoded in UTF-8. The SDK writes the latest log in agorasdk.log. When agorasdk.log is full, the SDK deletes the log file with the earliest modification time among the other four, renames agorasdk.log to the name of the deleted log file, and create a new agorasdk.log to record the latest logs.\n            If you want to set the size of the log file, you need to call this method before setLogFile, otherwise, the log will be cleared.",

Each log file has a default size of 512 KB. These log files are encoded in UTF-8. The SDK writes the latest log in agorasdk.log. When agorasdk.log is full, the SDK deletes the log file with the earliest modification time among the other four, renames agorasdk.log to the name of the deleted log file, and create a new agorasdk.log to record the latest logs.\n   Ensure that you call this method immediately after initializing RtcEngine, otherwise, the output log may not be complete.",

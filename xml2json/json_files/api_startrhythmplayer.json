    "description": "Enables the virtual metronome.\nIn music education, physical education and other scenarios, teachers usually need to use a metronome so that students can practice with the correct beat.  The meter is composed of a downbeat and upbeats. The first beat of each measure is called a downbeat, and the rest are called upbeats.\n            In this method, you need to set the paths of the upbeat and downbeat files, the number of beats per measure, the tempo, and whether to send the sound of the metronome to remote users.\n            \n                After enabling the virtual metronome, the SDK plays the specified audio effect file from the beginning, and controls the playback duration of each file according to beatsPerMinute you set in RhythmPlayerConfig. For example, if you set beatsPerMinute as 60, the SDK plays one beat every second. If the file duration exceeds the beat duration, the SDK only plays the audio within the beat duration.",

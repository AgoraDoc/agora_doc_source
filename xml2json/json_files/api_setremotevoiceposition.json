This method applies to massive multiplayer online games, such as Battle Royale games.\n   \n       \n  For this method to work, enable stereo panning for remote users by calling the enableSoundPositionIndication method before joining a channel.\n           For the best voice positioning, Agora recommends using a wired headset.\n  Call this method after joining a channel.",

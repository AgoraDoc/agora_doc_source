    "description": "Disables the video module.\nThis method disables video. You can call this method either before or after joining a channel. If you call it before joining a channel, an audio call starts when you join the channel. If you call it after joining a channel, a video call switches to an audio call. Call enableVideo to enable video.A successful call of this method triggers the userEnableVideo(false) callback on the remote client.\n   \n       This method affects the internal engine and can be called after leaving the channel.\n       This method resets the internal engine and takes some time to take effect. Agora recommends using the following API methods to control the video engine modules separately:\n                            enableLocalVideo: Whether to enable the camera to create the local video stream.\n                            muteLocalVideoStream: Whether to publish the local video stream.\n                            muteRemoteVideoStream: Whether to subscribe to and play the remote video stream.\n                            muteAllRemoteVideoStreams: Whether to subscribe to and play all remote video streams.",

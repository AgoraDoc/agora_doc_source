For example, it prioritizes smoothness and low latency for a video call and prioritizes video quality for interactive live video streaming.\n   \n       \n  To ensure the quality of real-time communication, Agora recommends that all users in a channel use the same channel profile.\n  This method must be called and set before joinChannel, and cannot be set again after entering the channel.",

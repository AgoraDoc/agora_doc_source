    "description": "Reports the last mile network quality of each user in the channel.\nThis callback reports the last mile network conditions of each user in the channel. Last mile refers to the connection between the local device and Agora's edge server.\n   The SDK triggers this callback once every two seconds. If a channel includes multiple users, the SDK triggers this callback as many times.",

This parameter is a quality rating helping you understand\n                        how well the current uplink network conditions can support the selected\n                        video encoder configuration. For example, a 1000 Kbps uplink network may be\n                        adequate for video frames with a resolution of 640 × 480 and a frame rate of\n                        15 fps in the LIVE_BROADCASTING profile, but might be inadequate for\n                        resolutions higher than 1280 × 720."

    "description": "Starts an audio call test.\nThis method starts an audio call test to determine whether the audio devices (for example, headset and speaker) and the network connection are working properly. To conduct the test, let the user speak for a while, and the recording is played back within the set interval. If the user can hear the recording within the interval, the audio devices and network connection are working properly.\n            \n                \n                    Call this method before joining a channel.\n                    After calling stopEchoTest, you must call startEchoTest to end the test. Otherwise, the app cannot perform the next echo test, and you cannot join the channel.\n                    In the live streaming channels, only a host can call this method.",

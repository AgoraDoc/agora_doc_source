    "description": "Sets an SDK preset audio effect.\nCall this method to set an SDK preset audio effect for the local user who sends an audio stream. This audio effect does not change the gender characteristics of the original voice. After setting an audio effect, all users in the channel can hear the effect.\n   To get better audio effect quality, Agora recommends calling setAudioProfile and setting the scenario parameter as GameStreaming (3) before calling this method.\n   \n       \n  You can call this method either before or after joining a channel.\n  Do not set the profile parameter in setAudioProfile to SpeechStandard (1), or the method does not take effect.\n  This method works best with the human voice. Agora does not recommend using this method for audio containing music.\n  If you call setAudioEffectPreset and set enumerators except for RoomAcoustics3DVoice or PitchCorrection, do not call setAudioEffectParameters; otherwise, setAudioEffectPreset is overridden.\n  After calling setAudioEffectPreset, Agora recommends not calling the following methods, because they can override setAudioEffectPreset:\n         setVoiceBeautifierPreset\n         setLocalVoiceReverbPreset\n         setLocalVoiceChanger\n         setLocalVoicePitch\n         setLocalVoiceEqualization\n         setLocalVoiceReverb\n         setVoiceBeautifierParameters\n         setVoiceConversionPreset",
